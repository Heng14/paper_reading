### Papers on 3d vision related topic

I began to do research on 3d vision currently. I don't know much about this field so I will keep reading related papers and make some notes here.

- [Nerf:Neural Radiance Fields](nerf.md)
- [NeRF in the Wild: Neural Radiance Fields for Unconstrained Photo Collections](nerfw.md)
- [Nerfies: Deformable Neural Radiance Fields](nerfies.md)
- [D-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields for Dynamic Scenes](D-nerf.md)
- [Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields for Monocular 4D Facial Avatar Reconstruction](Dynamic-nerf.md)
- [Non-Rigid Neural Radiance Fields: Reconstruction and Novel View Synthesis of a Dynamic Scene From Monocular Video](NonRigidNerf.md)
